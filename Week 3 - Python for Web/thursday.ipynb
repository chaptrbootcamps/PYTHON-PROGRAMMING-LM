    "The Super Friends are alerted when a mysterious red light shines on diamonds and then vanishes. Our heroes discover that in the process, the diamonds are stolen and are replaced by imitations. Dr. LaBond, a misguided scientist and his \"trusted\" assistant Wilbur, are stealing diamonds to power the Planet Splitter, an invention which LaBond has perfected for the purpose of splitting a planet and using half of it to serve as a second Moon with the hopes of providing Earth with more natural resources, but Wendy and Marvin point out that a second Moon would cause terrible weather conditions on Earth. Dr. LaBond is certain the project will work, and has targeted the planet Signus Uno. However, the Super Friends have placed a microdot homing signal on one of the stolen diamonds. The real thief turns out to be Wilbur, who wanted the diamonds so badly, that he made false reports to let Dr. LaBond think that his project would work, when it was really a doomed failure all along. The center portion of this episode tells the origin of Superman, as narrated by Marvin, in hopes of dissuading Dr. LaBond and Wilbur from proceeding with their plans.</td></tr>\n",

    "The Super Friends close their first series by responding to ocean calamities when a mysterious red tide appears in the ocean that upsets the ecological balance of the sea. It is the work of Holo and Zara, a pair of water people from another planet who are trying to gather enough silicon to get their mother ship, inhabited by the rest of their people, home. The Super Friends are aided by Professor Matey and his submarine which is used as their base. The biggest highlight of the episode is watching the big swim chase in the ocean when Aquaman chases after Holo.</td></tr></tbody></table>"
