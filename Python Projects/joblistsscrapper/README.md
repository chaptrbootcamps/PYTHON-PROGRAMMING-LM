# Job Lists Scraper
### Implement a Jobs scraper for different Job Listing Platforms.
In this project, you will be working in teams to build a scraper that seeks to understand the popularity of different programming langauges in the job markets. You will be tasked to scrape the number of jobs for the following programming languages across different jobs sites and compile your results into a sorted dictionary:
1. JavaScript
2. Python
3. Java
4. Ruby
5. Go

To get this data you will required to scrape the following websites which are the most popular sites for job listings locally:
- [Fuzu](https://www.fuzu.com/job)
- [Brighter Monday](https://www.brightermonday.co.ke/jobs)
- [My Job Mag](https://www.myjobmag.co.ke/)

Note that to scrape these job sites, I would recommend you make a search on the sites provided to see where the search query will appear on the site URL. It is this URL that you will scrape by modifying the search query to your target programming language from the list above. To make your work easier you can automate this process by working with loops and string methods to automatically replace the query parameter on the URL before scraping. You can also learn from the [Chaptr Jobs Scraper](https://github.com/chaptrbootcamps/on-demand-tech-skills) if you would like to see a different and more advanced implementation, however, you do not have to go as advanced.
