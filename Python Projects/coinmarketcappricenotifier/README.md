# CoinMarketCap Price Notifier
### Build a desktop notifier to update you once your cryptos hit a set price with the CoinMarketCap API
In this project, you will work with the CoinMarketCap API to monitor prices of your set group on cryptocurrencies. This could be anything from Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum to any of the less known cyrptocurrencies in [the CoinMarketCap listing](https://coinmarketcap.com/). Once you have a solid price monitor through the API, you will create a desktop notifier to send pop-up nofications once your cyrptocurrencies hit a particular price point. This could be a higher price point so that you can sell and make profits or a low price so that you can dispose the crypto-asset before getting into loss territory. Feel free to use public resources to learn how to build desktop notifiers with Python and you can follow the CoinMarketCap API documentation to learn how to work with the the API and monitor prices automatically or at time intervals.
